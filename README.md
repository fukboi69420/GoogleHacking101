Google Dorking is a technique of using advanced search operators and parameters to find specific information on the web. It can be used for security research, ethical hacking, or simply to speed up your online searching. In this cheatsheet, I will show you some basic and advanced Google Dorking commands and examples.

## Basic Google Dorking Syntax
The basic syntax for Google Dorking is:
```
operator:parameter
```
The operator specifies the type of search you want to perform, such as finding a specific site, file type, or keyword. The parameter is the value that you want to search for. For example:
```
site:github.com
```
This will search for all pages on github.com.

You can also combine multiple operators and parameters with a space to refine your search. For example:
```
site:github.com filetype:md
```
This will search for all Markdown files on github.com.
