Google Hacking DataBase (GHDB)
Google Hacking refers to the practice of using search engines, like Google and Bing, in order to discover
vulnerable web pages and critical information. It's based on the idea that search engines index a lot of public
pages and files, making their discovery a simple matter of building the correct query. Simply place the search
string from a database in the Search box and youâ€™re on your way.
For example, it's trivial to look for a specific type of file (filetype:), on a specific domain (site:), with a specific
name (inurl:), containing a certain string (intext:).
The Google Hacking Database (GHDB) was started by Johnny Long, who also published books on the matter,
but is now mantained and updated at Exploit Database. The strings are constantly updated. The Google
Hacking Database (GHDB) is a compiled list of common mistakes web/server admins make, which can be
easily searched by using Google. As a result, you can find things like administrator consoles, password files,
credit card numbers, unprotected webcams, etc.
There is also FSDB (Foundstone database). The FSDB is a list of queries that Foundstone has included in
addition to the public/commonly known GHDB ones.
GHDB and FSDM contain common search strings for locating vulnerable websites on the Internet, performing
DDoS attacks or just general poking around . An example:
https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=filetype:config%20inurl:web.config%20inurl:ftp
Sites: Exploit DataBase and hackersforcharity have more info on the actual queries, how they're structured,
and what kind of information you can find. The SiteDigger tool gives an indication as to the type of
information you can find, but is not as specific as the above mentioned sites.
